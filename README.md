# PySnake
# Welcome to my version of Snake Xenzia!

I created this Python game using my knowledge of the Turtle graphics library and object-oriented programming. 

In this classic arcade game, you control a snake that must eat food to grow longer. But be careful not to run into the walls or your own body!
Use the arrow keys to move around the screen and try to get the highest score possible.

To run the game, you'll need to have Python 3 and the Turtle graphics library installed on your computer.
Once you have everything set up, download all the ".py" files to a directory and run the "main.py" file to start the program.

I've used the concept of object-oriented programming to create different classes for the snake, food, and game, making the 
code more organized and easier to understand.

Try it out and see if you can beat your high score!
